# It's fun to use technology to answer questions and solve people's problems.

I've worked for over ten years as a software support engineer in two different companies The jobs have been very different in many ways. But both have some interesting points of relevance to a data analyst's role.

In both jobs, I was promoted to "senior" support engineer, which means that my coworkers ask me about things I don't know. And I go find the answers. :-) 

- Time series database
- It's language
- Training
- Devs-Writer-Sales-Customers
- Helping programmers

- Global SMS
- Less software, more data work
- Find real scope of problem vs report
- Large numbers of messages, and data about each
- Given some overall drop in success rate, drill down to find carrier, customer, sending number, specific error
- Pivot
-   Or csv -> Excel Pivot Table
- *Communicate* back to customer so they can understand and take action.
- Account managers with questions or data requests.

Like the focus of a real person with a real problem or question. Vs doing the tasks of a role, or writing code on a project which might never go live.

SQL (from various languages) Python, R (Google Cert), Tableau (Pivot), Excel

Cleaning with a language -> Drag-n-Drop-n-Graph....            Wheee!
